1 introduction the movidius neural compute stick ( ncs ) is a tiny fanless deep learning device that you can use to learn ai programming at the edge. ncs is powered by the same low power high performance movidius vision processing unit ( vpu ) that can be found in millions of smart security cameras, gesture controlled drones, industrial machine vision equipment, and more. this project is a ros2 wrapper for nc api of ncsdk , providing the following features: a ros2 service for object classification and detection of a static image file a ros2 publisher for object classification and detection of a video stream from a rgb camera demo applications to show the capabilities of ros2 service and publisher support multiple cnn models of caffe and tensorflow 2 prerequisite an x86_64 computer running ubuntu 16.04. os x and windows are not supported yet ros2 bouncy movidius neural compute stick (ncs) movidius neural compute (mvnc) sdk movidius neural compute application zoo rgb camera, e.g. realsense d400 series 3 environment setup install opencv 3.x ( guide ) install ros2 ardent ( guide ) create a ros2 workspace mkdir -p ~ /ros2_ws/src install ncsdk v1.12.00 ( github ) install nc app zoo( github ) ncsdk should be installed in /opt/movidius by default. create a symbol link in /opt/movidius to nc app zoo. sudo ln -s < your-workspace > /ncappzoo /opt/movidius/ncappzoo after that, make sure you can find graph data in /opt/movidius/ncappzoo/caffe or /opt/movidius/ncappzoo/tensorflow and image data in /opt/movidius/ncappzoo/data/images install object_msgs for ros2 ( github ) install ros2 package for different cameras as needed. e.g. realsense d400 series camera ( github ) note : create a symbol link from libusb.a to libusb-1.0.a, otherwise "libusb.a" is probably not to be found by librealsense. sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libusb-1.0.a /usr/lib/libusb.a install ros2 message filters ( github ) cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu sudo ln -s libboost_python-py35.so libboost_python3.so cd ~ /ros2_ws/src git clone https://github.com/ros2/message_filters install ros2 vision_opencv ( github ) cd ~ /ros2_ws/src git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv cd vision_opencv git checkout ros2 4 building and installation cd ~ /ros2_ws/src git clone https://github.com/intel/ros2_intel_movidius_ncs git clone https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_msgs cd ~ /ros2_ws ament build source install/local_setup.bash copy object label file from this project to ncsdk installation location. cp ~ /ros2_ws/src/ros2_intel_movidius_ncs/data/labels/ * /opt/movidius/ncappzoo/data/ilsvrc12/ 5 running the demo 5.1 classification 5.1.1 supported cnn models table1 cnn model framework usage alexnet caffe image / video googlenet caffe image / video squeezenet caffe image / video inception_v1 tensorflow image / video inception_v2 tensorflow image / video inception_v3 tensorflow image / video inception_v4 tensorflow image / video mobilenet tensorflow image / video 5.1.2 classification result with googlenet 5.1.3 running the demo static image video streaming 5.2 detection 5.1.1 supported cnn models cnn model framework usage mobilenetssd(recommended) caffe image / video tinyyolo_v1 caffe image / video 5.1.2 detection result with mobilenetssd 5.1.3 running the demo static image video streaming 6 interfaces 6.1 topic classification: /movidius_ncs_nodelet/classified_objects detection: /movidius_ncs_nodelet/detected_objects 6.2 service classification: /movidius_ncs_image/classify_object detection: /movidius_ncs_image/detect_object 7 known issues only absolute path of image file supported in image inference demo only test on realsense d400 series camera 8 todo keep synchronized with ros ncs package any security issue should be reported using process at https://01.org/security  no description, website, or topics provided. resources readme license apache-2.0 license security policy security policy activity custom properties stars 26 stars watchers 10 watching forks 16 forks report repository releases 1 tags packages 0 no packages published contributors 7 languages c++ 81.6% cmake 16.5% python 1.9% you cant perform that action at this time.
