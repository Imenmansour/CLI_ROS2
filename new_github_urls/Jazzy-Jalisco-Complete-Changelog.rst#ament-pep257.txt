( #672 ) ( #673 ) * fix gcc warnings when building with optimizations. when building the allocator_tutorial_pmr demo with -o2, gcc is throwing an error saying that new and delete are mismatched. this is something of a misnomer, however; the real problem is that the global new override we have in that demo is actually implemented incorrectly. in particular, the documentation at https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new very clearly specifies that operator new either has to return a valid pointer, or throw an exception on error. our version wasn't throwing the exception, so change it to throw std::bad_alloc if std::malloc fails. while we are in here, also fix another small possible is where std::malloc could return nullptr on a zero-sized object, thus throwing an exception it shouldn't. * always inline the new and delete operators. that's because gcc 13 has a bug where it can sometimes inline one or the other, and then it detects that they mismatch. for gcc and clang, just force them to always be inline in this demo. * switch to noinline instead. both clang and msvc don't like inlining these, so instead ensure that they are not inlined. this also works because the problem is when new is inlined but not delete (or vice-versa). as long as they are both not inlined, this should fix the warning.

( #4 ) * patch the pkg-config directory in the gz-cmake code. when building on the ros 2 buildfarm, we aren't setting some of the cmake_prefix variables. this means that using cmake_install_full_libdir actually creates a path like /opt/ros/rolling/... , which makes debuild upset. however, we actually need the full_libdir in order to calculate the relative path between it and the install_prefix. work around this by having two variables; the pkgconfig_install_dir (relative), used to install the files, and pkgconfig_abs_install_dir (absolute), used to calculate the relative path between them. this should fix the build on the buildfarm. i'll note that we are doing it here and not in gz-cmake proper because of knock-on effects to downstream gazebo. if this is successful we may end up merging it there, at which point we can drop this patch. * update gzpackage as well. --------- require calling find_package on the underlying package ( #3 ) this also changes the version of the vendor package to 0.0.1 and adds the version of the vendored package in the description fix linter ( #2 ) use <depend> on upstream package so that dependency is exported update maintainer add package.xml and cmakelists ( #1 ) initial import contributors: addisu z. taddese, chris lalancette gz_math_vendor use an alias target for root library add support for the <pkg>::<pkg> and <pkg>::all targets, fix sourcing of dsv files disable swig to fix cmake warning disable pybind11 for now require calling find_package on the underlying package ( #2 ) fix linter ( #1 ) remove nate update maintainers initial import contributors: addisu z. taddese gz_utils_vendor use an alias target for root library add support for the <pkg>::<pkg> and <pkg>::all targets, fix sourcing of dsv files require calling find_package on the underlying package ( #2 ) fix linter ( #1 ) initial import contributors: addisu z. taddese image_tools a few uncrustify fixes for 0.78.

( #96 ) ( #97 ) in cmake 3.3, a commit made it so that the find_package module in cmake had a compatibility mode where it would automatically search for packages in a <prefix>/lib subdirectory. in cmake 3.6, this compatibility mode was reverted for all platforms except windows. that means that since cmake 3.3, we haven't actually been using the path as specified in curl_dir , but we have instead been inadvertently relying on that fallback behavior. in cmake 3.28, that compatibilty mode was also removed for windows, meaning that we are now failing to find_package(curl) in downstream packages (like resource_retriever). fix this by adding in the "lib" directory that always should have been there. i'll note that this only affects our windows builds, because this code is in a if(win32) block.

( #27 ) ( #28 ) when initially building the orocos_kdl_vendor package (on platforms where it actually builds), it turns out that it places a valid cmake configuration in the build directory. in turn, that means that a subsequent rebuild will find this configuration in the build directory, and throw the rest of the logic off. this only seems to be a problem with cmake 3.29 and later, though i can't say exactly why at the moment. workaround this problem by writing the configuration out to a temporary file, and then moving it into the final place with the final name.

( #1167 ) the situation is complicated, but in versions of ubuntu prior to focal and versions of debian prior to bookworm, the name of the library was 'libfreetype6-dev'. since focal and bookworm, the name of the library is 'libfreetype-dev'. while 'libfreetype-dev' provides a "virtual package" for 'libfreetype6-dev', we should really use the new canonical name. further, there is currently a bug on ros_buildfarm where it doesn't properly deal with "virtual packages" like this. this is currently preventing this package from building on ubuntu noble. that bug is being worked on separately. finally, i'll note that we already have a libfreetype-dev key in rosdep, so we just switch to using that here which should work around the bug on the buildfarm, and also use the correct canonical name going forward. fix: modify typo in cmake args for mac ( #1160 ) feat: support macos ( #1156 ) suppress a couple more of clang warnings in rviz_ogre_vendor.
