this isn't the first time we've needed to change api in rmw and it won't be the last, so i think having tools for you to have a "single" source is out of scope for this pr at least. all reactions sorry, something went wrong. link to design document in todo  09f64c7 signed-off-by: william woodall <william@osrfoundation.org> mjcarroll approved these changes oct 7, 2019 view reviewed changes eboasson mentioned this pull request oct 8, 2019 consider versioning the rmw interface #188 closed wjwwood merged commit ca572aa into master oct 8, 2019 delete-merged-branch bot deleted the rmw_specific_payload_for_pub_sub_creation branch october 8, 2019 22:40 eboasson mentioned this pull request oct 9, 2019 update signature for added pub/sub options ros2/rmw_cyclonedds#46 closed ivanpauno mentioned this pull request oct 10, 2019 not creating rosout publisher instance unless required. ros2/rcl#514 merged karsten1987 mentioned this pull request oct 17, 2019 fix the test failure of wrong messages count ros2/rosbag2#165 merged rotu mentioned this pull request oct 18, 2019 compatibility before and after rmw pub/sub option structures ros2/rmw_cyclonedds#51 merged  for free to join this conversation on github . already have an account?
