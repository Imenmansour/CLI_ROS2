it's the same case as with ros2 bag play --regex all reactions sorry, something went wrong. copy link contributor jhdcs commented jul 22, 2022 i feel like keeping it consistent would be best, at least for the moment. if in future we decide that we need to have multiple regular expression support, we can open a new issue at that time and change everything over. all reactions sorry, something went wrong. esteve marked this pull request as draft august 2, 2022 14:02 esteve force-pushed the exclude-topics branch from 7bd6d35 to 98075c4 compare august 3, 2022 09:33 added support for excluding topics via regular expressions  68055e8 signed-off-by: esteve fernandez <esteve.fernandez@tier4.jp> esteve force-pushed the exclude-topics branch from 98075c4 to 68055e8 compare august 3, 2022 10:50 esteve marked this pull request as ready for review august 3, 2022 10:51 copy link member author esteve commented aug 3, 2022 @jhdcs i've updated this pr so that ros2 bag play --exclude only takes one regex, so that it matches the behavior of ros2 bag record --exclude all reactions sorry, something went wrong. esteve mentioned this pull request aug 3, 2022 [humble] backport. added support for excluding topics via regular expressions #1059 closed copy link contributor michaelorlov commented aug 8, 2022 gist: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/michaelorlov/4ddd09a6f289164fd88305e18d2c6c78/raw/06ed49f0a9fbb6fc94981ef7e363abac755edc6f/ros2.repos build args: --packages-above-and-dependencies ros2bag rosbag2_py rosbag2_storage rosbag2_storage_default_plugins rosbag2_transport rosbag2_tests test args: --packages-above ros2bag rosbag2_py rosbag2_storage rosbag2_storage_default_plugins rosbag2_transport rosbag2_tests ros distro: rolling job: ci_launcher ci_launcher ran: https://ci.ros2.org/job/ci_launcher/10634 linux linux-aarch64 windows all reactions sorry, something went wrong. copy link member author esteve commented sep 5, 2022 @jhdcs @michaelorlov the ci issues don't seem to be related to the changes in this pr, but i could be wrong. did they happen in previous prs?
