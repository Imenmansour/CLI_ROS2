[ros2 tutorial]- how to launch a ros2 node written by alberto ezquerro  ros2 tutorials  02/07/2019 welcome to the ros2 tutorial series. in this first video we are going to show how to launch a node in ros2 . commands to use: ros2 run ros2 pkg list ros2 pkg executables source /opt/ros/crystal/setup.bash step1. lets do this in ros development studio(rds) at first, we have to find a linux computer, install ros, build all the package we need andcrashnooooo!!! of course, you can do all this painfully on your own computer, but well use rosds through this ros2 tutorial because we can easily build a project on it without setting up any environment locally. you can create an account here for free. after logging in, click on the new rosject button. lets call this project ros2_tutorial and open it by clicking on the open rosject button. step2. launching a ros2 node if you know ros1 you may remember that in order to run a node on that ros version we use the rosrun <package_name> <executable_name> command. with ros2 its you almost dont see any difference, given that we use ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name> . before launching a node we first need to know the list of ros2 packages installed. we can do that with the following command: ros2 pkg list with the command above we can see that among the packages we have one named demo_nodes_cpp , as can be seen with ros2 pkg list | grep demo . to see the list of ros2 executable files on our system we can run the command below: ros2 pkg executables the output provided by the command below is a list of <package_name> <executable_name>. in case you want to reduce the output and list only the desired package, by using grep we can do that. given that we are interested on the demo_nodes_cpp package, lets filter it with ros2 pkg executables | grep demo_nodes_cpp . the output will be something like: demo_nodes_cpp add_two_ints_client demo_nodes_cpp add_two_ints_client_async demo_nodes_cpp add_two_ints_server demo_nodes_cpp allocator_tutorial demo_nodes_cpp imu_listener demo_nodes_cpp list_parameters demo_nodes_cpp list_parameters_async demo_nodes_cpp listener demo_nodes_cpp listener_best_effort demo_nodes_cpp one_off_timer demo_nodes_cpp parameter_events demo_nodes_cpp parameter_events_async demo_nodes_cpp parameter_node demo_nodes_cpp reuse_timer demo_nodes_cpp ros2param demo_nodes_cpp set_and_get_parameters demo_nodes_cpp set_and_get_parameters_async demo_nodes_cpp talker demo_nodes_cpp_native talker we can see that we have among the executable files we have one called talker and another one called listener . for former writes data on a topic while the latter listens to that topic and print the received messages. lets first launch the listener in background: ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener & now lets launch the talker and see the logs of both nodes: ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker after running the talker you should see something like the messages below: [info] [talker]: publishing: "hello world: 1" [info] [listener]: i heard: [hello world: 1] [info] [talker]: publishing: "hello world: 2" [info] [listener]: i heard: [hello world: 2] ... so this is the post for today. it is really simple, but lets go step by step learning a little bit of ros2 every day. lets keep pushing and we will be ros2 experts in no time. to conclude, in case you also want to learn ros1, we have complete courses in python and c++ on that subject. you can take those courses by clicking on the links below: ros basics in 5 days (python): http://bit.ly/2drzr87 ros basics in 5 days (c++): http://bit.ly/2dt3gfk those are online courses in the robot ignite academy, where you are going to learn ros fast using online simulations. related resources: ros development studio (rds) : develop your ros2 project online ros2 basics course ros python (for beginners) ros c++ (for beginners) feedback: did you like this post?
