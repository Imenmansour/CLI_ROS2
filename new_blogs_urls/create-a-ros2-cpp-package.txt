out ros2 for beginners and learn ros2 step by step, in 1 week. correctly installed ros2, setup your environment (add source /opt/ros/ros_version/setup.bash source /opt/ros/ros_version/setup.bash in your .bashrc  dont forget to replace ros_version), and created a ros2 workspace (  mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src && cd ~/ros2_ws/ && colcon build  mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src && cd ~/ros2_ws/ && colcon build ). now, to create a cpp package, execute: plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/  ros2 pkg create my_cpp_pkg --build-type ament_cmake

</package> if you ever share or publish your package, youll need to edit 4 lines in order to provide more information: version. description: quickly say what your package does. maintainer: fill in your name and email so that people can reach to you in case they have an issue with the package. you can also add an author tag in addition to the maintainer tag, if for example you wrote the package but someone else is in charge of maintaining it. and you can of course have multiple author and maintainer tags. license: especially useful if you publish your project online. having a license tells people what they can do (and cant do) with your package. of course the package will correctly work even if you dont edit those lines now, but dont forget to add required info before you share your work. cmakelists.txt in this file youll tell the compiler how to create your nodes, where to install them, where to install other files, how to link dependencies, etc. by default cmakelists.txt is already filled with the basics. you can clean it up a bit so it doesnt become bloated too soon. heres the minimal cmakelists.txt i use. i removed the comments, the default to c99 section (since well only use cpp 14), and the test sections. note: testing is very important. in this tutorial we only cover how to write minimal code, so we dont need tests. plain text copy to clipboard open code in new

find_package(ament_cmake required) find_package(ament_cmake required) and ament_package() ament_package() . include/<package_name>/ folder in ros2 the recommended way to write nodes is to use oop. thus in this folder youll write the .hpp files containing class and method declarations for your nodes, as well as library headers you wish to export. for our example this folder is named include/my_cpp_package/. src/ folder in this src/ folder youll write the implementation for the classes you create. also this will be the place to write standalone nodes and main() functions that you want to execute. compile your package to compile your package, navigate into your ros2 workspace and use colcon build colcon build . add the option --packages-select my_cpp_pkg --packages-select my_cpp_pkg so you only build this package (this can save you some time if you have many other packages in your workspace). plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax

finished [1.84s] this will compile any cpp executable you defined in cmakelists.txt, and install them (+ some other files) into the install/ folder of your workspace. build a node inside a ros2 cpp package well now you know whats inside your cpp package. lets see how you can create a cpp node in this package, compile it, and run it. create a cpp file inside the src/ directory of your package. plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/src/  touch my_cpp_node.cpp  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/src/  touch my_cpp_node.cpp  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/src/  touch my_cpp_node.cpp heres a simple cpp node for the purpose of this tutorial. plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp" class mynode : public rclcpp::node { public : mynode () : node ( "my_node" ) { rclcpp_info ( this - > get_logger () , "hello cpp" ) ; } private : } ; int main ( int argc, char **argv ) { rclcpp:: init ( argc, argv ) ; auto node = std::make_shared < mynode >() ; rclcpp:: spin ( node ) ; rclcpp:: shutdown () ; } #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp" class mynode : public rclcpp::node { public: mynode() : node("my_node") { rclcpp_info(this->get_logger(), "hello cpp"); } private: }; int main(int argc, char **argv) { rclcpp::init(argc, argv); auto node = std::make_shared<mynode>(); rclcpp::spin(node); rclcpp::shutdown(); } #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp" class mynode : public rclcpp::node { public: mynode() : node("my_node") { rclcpp_info(this->get_logger(), "hello cpp"); } private: }; int main(int argc, char **argv) { rclcpp::init(argc, argv); auto node = std::make_shared<mynode>(); rclcpp::spin(node); rclcpp::shutdown(); } this node does just one thing: say hello when its started, and thats it. then it spins until you kill it. for more info  how to write cpp node, check out this ros2 cpp node tutorial . add those lines into your cmakelists.txt, between find_package(ament_cmake required) find_package(ament_cmake required) and ament_package() ament_package() . plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter ... find_package(rclcpp required) add_executable(test_node src/my_cpp_node.cpp) ament_target_dependencies(test_node rclcpp) install(targets test_node destination lib/{project_name} ) ... ... find_package(rclcpp required) add_executable(test_node src/my_cpp_node.cpp) ament_target_dependencies(test_node rclcpp) install(targets test_node destination lib/{project_name} ) ... ... find_package(rclcpp required) add_executable(test_node src/my_cpp_node.cpp) ament_target_dependencies(test_node rclcpp) install(targets test_node destination lib/{project_name} ) ... this will create an executable named test_node, from the file you created inside the src/ folder. this test_node executable will be installed into ~/ros2_ws/install/my_cpp_pkg/lib/my_cpp_pkg/. make sure you dont mix the executable name (test_node), the source file name (my_cpp_node), and the node name (my_node, defined in the source file). if you want though, you can make them 3 identical, this will also work  but be careful  not mixing things up. note: if you want to split your file, one .hpp and one .cpp, and place the .hpp in the include/my_cpp_package/ directory, then youll need to add this line: include_directories(include) include_directories(include) , just after the find_package(...) find_package(...) lines. otherwise the compiler wont look into the include/ folder and youll get an error. one final addition: add < depend > rclcpp </ depend > <depend>rclcpp</depend> just after < buildtool _depend > ament_cmake</buildtool_depend> <buildtool_depend>ament_cmake</buildtool_depend> in your package.xml file. now you can compile your package with colcon build --packages-select my_cpp_pkg colcon build --packages-select my_cpp_pkg . open a new terminal, source your environment, and run your node: plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter  ros2 run my_cpp_pkg test_node [info] [my_node]: hello cpp  ros2 run my_cpp_pkg test_node [info] [my_node]: hello cpp  ros2 run my_cpp_pkg test_node [info] [my_node]: hello cpp add other files in your ros2 cpp package you can install any file you want from your package, youre absolutely not limited to cpp nodes. installing a file, here, simply means that it will be copied into the install/ folder of your ros2 workspace. lets see an example with some of the most used ones: launch files and yaml config files. launch files take the habit of placing your launch files inside a launch/ folder. so, create a launch/ folder at the root of your package. plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/  mkdir launch  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/  mkdir launch  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/  mkdir launch to install your launch files youll need to add this to your cmakelists.txt: plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter ... install(directory launch destination share/{project_name} ) ... ... install(directory launch destination share/{project_name} ) ... ... install(directory launch destination share/{project_name} ) ... the launch/ folder will be copied and install into ~/ros2_ws/install/my_cpp_pkg/share/my_cpp_pkg/launch/. you only need to configure this once for all launch files. yaml config files the technique is the same as for launch files. first, create a config/ folder at the root of your package. plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/  mkdir config  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/  mkdir config  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/  mkdir config and add this to your cmakelists.txt: plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter ... install(directory config destination share/{project_name} ) ... ... install(directory config destination share/{project_name} ) ... ... install(directory config destination share/{project_name} ) ... after the compilation you will find yaml files inside the ~/ros2_ws/install/my_cpp_pkg/share/my_cpp_pkg/config/ folder. now, for any other file or folder you wish to install from your ros2 cpp package, you can do the same. ros2 cpp package: going further in this tutorial youve seen how to create, configure, and compile a ros2 cpp package, with nodes, launch files, and yaml config files. heres the final architecture that we have after all those steps.
