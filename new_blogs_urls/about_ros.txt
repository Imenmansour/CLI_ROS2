esol  esol's embedded platforms and engineering services support ros/ros2 and commercialization to embedded systems mar 24, 2022 9:22:02 am the market for robots is broadly divided into industrial robots and service robots. as of 2021, approximately three million industrial robots are operating at plants worldwide, and shipments are expected to increase year after year beyond 2022. 1 in addition, due to covid-19, global sales of service robots for service robots increased by 32% y/y to approximately us11.2 billion 2 , and demand for service robots is expected to continue to increase in fields such as medical care, logistics, and home delivery. robot operating system, commonly known as ros, is an open-source (oss) application framework for robotics. with the growing complexity and scale of software development and research, the ros provides engineers and developers with a standard set of software libraries and tools to help them build robot applications. want to know more? you will find some resources you might find useful here while ros2 adopts the main concepts of ros, it is currently being developed through the addition of concepts that are essential for commercialization and practical implementation. this includes multi-platform support, real-time control, enhanced fault tolerance, and support for multiple robots, including embedded devices. esol supports the application and commercialization of ros/ros2 with a scalable embedded platform for both solutions and engineering services that leverage its wealth of knowledge. effective autonomous control system development solutions utilizing ros/ros2 using the ros on emcos platform, a scalable embedded platform that supports ros/ros2, can help develop efficient autonomous control robots and autonomous driving systems as well as provide an execution environment for embedded systems that can be applied to product development. features of ros on emcos include: provides scalable support for single-core to multi/many-core processors as well as multiple chips with the emcos distributed microkernel architecture enables the use of rich software resources in embedded processors without changing the ros/ros 2 build system provides real-time os-specific features, including lightweight, real-time threading products and services provided by esol esol supports the commercialization of high-reliability robot systems to ensure quality and facilitate functional safety by providing ros/ros2 engineering services that use our extensive experience and know-how, as well as providing software platform technologies based on the emcos real-time operating system for autonomous distributed cooperative systems. ros/ros2 engineering services include: ros/ros2 application development integration of ros/ros2 with existing systems robot control device driver development slam prototype development using commercially available robots research and development of embedded ros if you have any questions  ros/ros2 solutions and engineering services, please get in touch with esol. references [1] international federation of robotics: ifr presents world robotics 2021 reports , 28 october 2021 [2] international federation of robotics: service robot record: sales worldwide up 32% , 28 october 2020 downloadable materials [1] emcos-based engineering services for ros/ros2 [2] ros2 engineering service based on renesas rx65n microcontrollers for industrial iot systems e.v  communications team back to the  list recent posts posts by tag embedded software solutions (47) emcos (44) products & solutions (35) events & seminars (25) multi/many-core (19) embedded (17) automotive (13) technical article (13) automotive software (11) latest news (10) autosar (8) materials (8) emcos posix (8) ros & autoware (7) industrial iot (6) virtualization solutions (6) emcos hypervisor (6) et-kernel (6) functional safety (5) ros/ros 2 (4) industrial (3) safety & security (3) article in english (2) ebinder (2) ci/cd (1) software frameworks (1) embp (1) see all archive june 2024 (1) april 2024 (1) march 2024 (1) february 2024 (1) december 2023 (1) october 2023 (1) september 2023 (1) august 2023 (1) june 2023 (1) may 2023 (1) april 2023 (1) march 2023 (1) february 2023 (1) january 2023 (1) december 2022 (1) november 2022 (1) october 2022 (1) september 2022 (1) august 2022 (1) july 2022 (1) june 2022 (1) may 2022 (1) april 2022 (1) march 2022 (1) february 2022 (1) january 2022 (1) december 2021 (1) october 2021 (1) august 2021 (1) july 2021 (1) june 2021 (2) may 2021 (2) april 2021 (2) march 2021 (1) february 2021 (1) january 2021 (2) december 2020 (2) november 2020 (1) october 2020 (1) september 2020 (1) july 2020 (3) june 2020 (2) may 2020 (2) april 2020 (3) march 2020 (2) february 2020 (1) january 2020 (1) november 2019 (1) october 2019 (1) september 2019 (2) august 2019 (1) may 2019 (1) april 2019 (1) see all
