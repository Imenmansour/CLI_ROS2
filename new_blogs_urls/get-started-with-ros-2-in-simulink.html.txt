create a publisher configure a block to send a geometry_msgs/point message to a topic named /location (the " / " is standard ros syntax). from the matlab toolstrip, select home > new > simulink model to open a new simulink model. from the simulink toolstrip, select simulation > library browser to open the simulink library browser. click on the ros toolbox tab (you can also type roslib in matlab command window). select the ros 2 library. drag a publish block to the model. double-click on the block to configure the topic and message type. select specify your own for the topic source , and enter /location in topic . click select next to message type . a pop-up window will appear. select geometry_msgs/point and click ok to close the pop-up window. you can also specify the ros 2 domain id by clicking configure ros 2 domain id and ros middleware (rmw) option. create a ros 2 message create a blank ros 2 message and populate it with the x and y location for the robot path. then publish the updated ros 2 message to the ros 2 network. a ros 2 message is represented as a bus signal in simulink. a bus signal is a bundle of simulink signals, and can also include other bus signals (see the explore simulink bus capabilities (simulink) example for an overview). the ros 2 blank message block outputs a simulink bus signal corresponding to a ros 2 message. click ros toolbox tab in the library browser, or type roslib at the matlab command line. select the ros 2 library. drag a blank message block to the model. double-click on the block to open the block mask. click on select next to the message type box, and select geometry_msgs/point from the resulting pop-up window. set sample time to 0.01. click ok to close the block mask. from the simulink > signal routing tab in the library browser, drag a bus assignment block. connect the output port of the blank message block to the bus input port of the bus assignment block. connect the output port of the bus assignment block to the input port of publish block. double-click on the bus assignment block. you should see x, y and z (the signals comprising a geometry_msgs/point message) listed on the left. select ??? signal1 in the right listbox and click remove . select both x and y signals in the left listbox and click select . click ok to apply changes. note: if you do not see x, y and z listed, close the block mask for the bus assignment block, and under the modeling tab , click update model to ensure that the bus information is correctly propagated. if you see the error, "selected signal 'signal1' in the bus assignment block cannot be found", it indicates that the bus information has not been propagated. close the diagnostic viewer, and repeat the above step. you can now populate the bus signal with the robot location. from the simulink > sources tab in the library browser, drag two sine wave blocks into the model. connect the output ports of each sine wave block to the assignment input ports x and y of the bus assignment block. double-click on the sine wave block that is connected to input port x . set the phase parameter to -pi/2 and click ok . leave the sine wave block connected to input port y as default. your publisher should look like this: at this point, the model is set up to publish messages to the ros 2 network. you can verify this as follows: under the simulation tab, set the simulation stop time to inf . click run to start simulation. simulink creates a dedicated ros 2 node for the model and a ros 2 publisher corresponding to the publish block. while the simulation is running, type ros2 node list in the matlab command window. this lists all the nodes available in the ros network, and includes a node with a name like /untitled_90580 (the name of the model along with a random number to make it unique). while the simulation is running, type ros2 topic list in the matlab command window. this lists all the topics available in the ros 2 network, and it includes /location . if you specified a ros 2 domain id in the publish block, to list all the topics, type ros2 topic list domainid xx , where xx is the domain id you specified. click stop to stop the simulation. simulink deletes the ros 2 node and publisher. in general, the ros 2 node for a model and any associated publishers and subscribers are automatically deleted at the end of a simulation; no additional clean-up steps are required. create a subscriber use simulink to receive messages sent to the /location topic. you will extract the x and y location from the message and plot it in the xy-plane. from the ros toolbox tab in the library browser, drag a subscribe block to the model. double-click on the block. select specify your own in the topic source box, and enter /location in the topic box. click select next to the message type box, and select geometry_msgs/point from the pop-up window. set sample time to 0.01. click ok to close the block mask. the subscribe block outputs a simulink bus signal, so you need to extract the x and y signals from it. from the simulink > signal routing tab in the library browser, drag a bus selector block to the model. connect the msg output of the subscribe block to the input port of the bus selector block. from the modeling tab, select update model to ensure that the bus information is propagated. you may get errors and they will be resolved by the next step. double-click on the bus selector block. select signal1 and signal2 in the right listbox and click to remove them. select both x and y signals in the left listbox and click to select the signals. click ok . the subscribe block will output the most-recently received message for the topic on every time step. the isnew output indicates whether the message has been received during the prior time step. for the current task, the isnew output is not needed, so do the following: from the simulink > sinks tab in the library browser, drag a terminator block to the model. connect the isnew output of the subscribe block to the input of the terminator block. the remaining steps configure the display of the extracted x and y signals. from the simulink > sinks tab in the library browser, drag an xy graph block to the model. connect the output ports of the bus selector block to the input ports of the xy graph block. from the simulink > sinks tab in the library browser, drag two display blocks to the model. connect each output of the bus selector block to each display block. save your model. your entire model should look like this: configure and run the model from the modeling tab, select model settings . in the solver pane, set type to fixed-step and fixed-step size to 0.01 . set simulation stop time to 10.0 . click run to start simulation. an xy plot will appear. the first time you run the model in simulink, the xy plot may look more jittery than the one above due to delays caused by loading ros libraries. once you rerun the simulation a few times, the plot should look smoother. note that the simulation does not work in actual or "real" time. the blocks in the model are evaluated in a loop that only simulates the progression of time, and is not intended to track actual clock time (for details, see simulation loop phase (simulink) ). modify the model to react only to new messages in the above model, the subscribe block outputs a message (bus signal) on every time step; if no messages have been received at all, it outputs a blank message (i.e., a message with zero values). consequently, the xy coordinates are initially plotted at (0,0) . in this task, you will modify the model to use an enabled subsystem , so that it plots the location only when a new message is received (for more information, see using enabled subsystems (simulink) ). a pre-configured model is included for your convenience. in the model, click and drag to select the bus selector block and xy graph blocks. right-click on the selection and select create subsystem from selection . from the simulink > ports & subsystems tab in the library browser, drag an enable block into the newly-created subsystem. connect the isnew output of the subscribe block to the enabled input of the subsystem as shown in the picture below. delete the terminator block. note that the isnew output is true only if a new message was received during the previous time step. save your model. click run to start simulation. you should see the following xy plot. the blocks in the enabled subsystem are only executed when a new ros 2 message is received by the subscribe block. hence, the initial (0,0) value will not be displayed in the xy plot.  matlab command you clicked a link that corresponds to this matlab command: run the command by entering it in the matlab command window. web browsers do not support matlab commands. close  select a web site choose a web site to get translated content where available and see local events and offers. based on your location, we recommend that you select: . switzerland (english) switzerland (deutsch) switzerland (français) 中国 (简体中文) 中国 (english) you can also select a web site from the following list: how to get best site performance select the china site (in chinese or english) for best site performance. other mathworks country sites are not optimized for visits from your location. americas américa latina (español) canada (english) united states (english) europe belgium (english) denmark (english) deutschland (deutsch) españa (español) finland (english) france (français) ireland (english) italia (italiano) luxembourg (english) netherlands (english) norway (english) österreich (deutsch) portugal (english) sweden (english) switzerland deutsch english français united kingdom (english) asia pacific australia (english) india (english) new zealand (english) 中国 简体中文 english 日本 (日本語) 한국 (한국어)  your local office trial software trial software product updates product updates
