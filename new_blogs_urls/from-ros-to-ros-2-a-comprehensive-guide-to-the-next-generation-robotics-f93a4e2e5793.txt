in the field of robotics, known for its innovation and adaptability. in this section, we delve into the technical intricacies of ros, examining its core features, design goals, and architectural framework, while also highlighting the limitations that necessitated the evolution to ros 2. core features of ros design goals: emphasis on single-robot systems, reusability, and modularity at its core, ros was designed with a clear focus on single-robot applications . the frameworks architecture was built around a standardized collection of tools, libraries, and conventions, which streamlined the development process of robotic systems. this standardization was pivotal in expediting the development of a wide spectrum of robotic applications, from basic prototypes to more complex, integrated systems. the key design philosophy of ros centered on reusability and modularity . this was achieved by enabling developers to create and share interchangeable software components. such an ecosystem facilitated the construction of sophisticated and diverse robotic applications, effectively reducing development time and enhancing collaborative potential. modular architecture and communication patterns the architectural design of ros is characterized by its modularity. it operates on a network of nodes  individual processes or executables that perform specific functions like sensing, actuation, computation, or decision-making. these nodes communicate with each other via a publish-subscribe mechanism for data sharing or a client-server model for service requests. nodes are simply c++ programs or python script using the underlying ros libraries. a distinctive aspect of ross architecture is its reliance on a centralized node known as the ros master node ( roscore ). this node acts as a registry and facilitator for inter-node communication, maintaining a record of publishers, subscribers, and services. while this centralized design simplifies network management, it also introduces challenges in  of scalability and fault tolerance  a single point of failure can disrupt the entire network. limitations of ros despite ross widespread adoption and success, its design and architectural choices led to certain limitations: single-robot focus: the ros infrastructure was primarily tailored for individual robot systems, lacking inherent support for coordinated multi-robot operations. this focus limited its applicability in scenarios requiring swarm robotics or collaborative robotic systems. lack of real-time guarantees: ros did not natively support real-time processing, a critical requirement for applications demanding precise timing and synchronization, such as in industrial automation or autonomous vehicle navigation. scalability and reliability concerns: the dependence on the centralized ros master node raised scalability issues for larger, more complex systems. moreover, this single point of failure could compromise the reliability of the entire system. recognizing these limitations, the robotics community, led by the open source robotics foundation (osrf), initiated the development of ros 2. this next-generation framework aims to address the challenges of real-time processing, scalability, multi-robot systems, and overall system reliability, marking a significant leap in the evolution of robotic software frameworks. ros 2  the next generation ros 2 emerges as a beacon of this evolution, addressing the limitations of its predecessor, ros, and introducing a suite of advanced features and architectural enhancements. lets explore the design goals and architectural advancements that make ros 2 a pivotal development in robotics. design goals of ros 2 focus on swarm robotics: unlike ros, which was tailored for single-robot applications, ros 2 shifts its focus to swarm robotics. this change is significant because swarm robotics involves complex, coordinated behavior among multiple robots, demanding a more flexible and distributed communication infrastructure. ros 2s design facilitates efficient coordination and collective behavior, which are vital in swarm robotic applications. real-time and qos guarantees: one of the critical limitations of ros was its lack of support for real-time processing and quality of service (qos) guarantees. ros 2 places these features at the forefront. the ability to ensure real-time operation and prioritize message delivery based on their importance is crucial for applications like autonomous vehicles and industrial robotics, where timing and reliability are paramount. fast prototyping and cross-platform compatibility: ros 2 emphasizes ease of transition from prototyping to production, offering cross-platform compatibility. this aspect is crucial for the rapid development and deployment of applications across diverse platforms, making ros 2 more versatile and user-friendly than ros, especially in production environments. architectural advancements in ros 2 distributed by design: ros 2 introduces a fundamentally distributed architecture, a stark contrast to ross centralized design. by eliminating the need for a central master node, ros 2 overcomes the scalability and single-point-of-failure limitations of ros. this decentralized approach aligns better with the demands of large-scale, distributed robotic applications, ensuring more robust and reliable communication. enhanced scalability and modularity: continuing the ros tradition, ros 2 maintains a modular architecture but extends it with the concept of managed nodes. these nodes, governed by a lifecycle manager, provide greater control over the systems state and behavior. the scalability is further enhanced due to the distributed nature of ros 2, allowing more efficient management of a larger number of nodes. extended communication patterns: ros 2 retains the primary communication patterns of ros but introduces significant improvements. it incorporates quality of service (qos) policies for topics, enabling more precise control over message delivery. this addition, along with the retention of synchronous and asynchronous client/server models, makes communication in ros 2 more flexible and reliable. revolutionized client libraries and middleware: with ros 2, theres a shift to more robust and feature-rich client libraries, namely rclcpp for c++ and rclpy for python. the most notable advancement in ros 2 is the adoption of the data distribution service (dds) as its communication middleware. dds, known for its high-performance, real-time, scalable, and interoperable publish-subscribe communication, addresses the limitations of ross custom protocols. this transition not only enhances real-time capabilities and security mechanisms but also ensures interoperability with a broader range of systems and technologies. in summary, ros 2 represents a significant leap forward in robotic software frameworks. its emphasis on real-time
