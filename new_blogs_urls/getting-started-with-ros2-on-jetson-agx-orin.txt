ros 2 on the jetson agx orin. the performance of the new jetson agx orin  unlocks capabilities such as processing 3d data coming from multiple zed 2i depth cameras , making it the ideal combination for autonomous robotics and edge analytics solutions. it is now available for purchase at the stereolabs store . nvidia jetson agx orin reading this article you will learn how to make the jetson agx orin ready to control a robot and make it perceive the world in 3d by installing ros 2 foxy fitzroy standalone or inside a docker container. you will also learn how to use the latest nvidia jetpack sdk 5.0.2 which introduces jetson linux 35.1 , the first linux for tegra operating system based on ubuntu 20.04 . install the zed sdk on jetson agx orin before installing ros 2 you must first install the latest zed sdk for nvidia jetpack 5.0.2 if you have not already done it. you can download the installer from the developer section of the stereolabs website . you can read our guide to make the jetson agx orin ready for the first boot . open a terminal console and enter the following commands cd downloads chmod +x zed_sdk_tegra_l4t<os_ver>_v<sdk_ver>.run ./zed_sdk_tegra_l4t<os_ver>_v<sdk_ver>.run replace <os_ver> and <sdk_ver> with the correct values of the name of the file that you downloaded. when the process is completed you can install ros 2. how to install ros 2 foxy on jetson agx orin ros 2 is the new generation of the robotic operating system framework. ros 2 foxy fitzroy is not the latest lts distribution, ros 2 humble hawksbill has been recently released, but it requires ubuntu 22.04 for the binary installation and the latest jetson linux is based on ubuntu 20.04. when nvidia releases cuda, cudnn, and tensorrt for ubuntu 22.04, we will also release the zed sdk for the latest os version, and provide a guide to creating a docker container to run ros 2 humble on jetson agx orin. ros 2 foxy install ros 2 foxy make sure you have a locale that supports utf-8 locale # check for utf-8 sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales sudo locale-gen en_us en_us.utf-8 sudo update-locale lc_all=en_us.utf-8 lang=en_us.utf-8 export

/dev/null update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories sudo apt update ros 2 packages are built on frequently updated ubuntu systems. it is always recommended that you ensure your system is up to date before installing new packages sudo apt upgrade install the packages useful for a robotic platform sudo apt install ros-foxy-ros-base automatically source the environment setup script every time a new shell is launched. these commands will do that for you. bash shell echo "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc zsh shell echo "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc source ~/.zshrc install the dependencies to build packages sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git libbullet-dev

ros 2 wrapper the zed ros 2 wrapper is a ready package that allows integrating the zed sdk capabilities into the ros 2 world. the zed ros wrapper is open source and the code is available on github . mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src cd ~/ros2_ws/src/ git clone --recursive https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper.git cd .. rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y colcon build

want to test how ros 2 works on the jetson agx orin, we provide a full set of examples and tutorials cd ~/ros2_ws/src/ git clone https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-examples.git cd ../ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args=-dcmake_build_type=release source ~/.bashrc note: using the flag --recursive with the git clone command is really important to install the zed-ros2-interfaces repository as a sub-module and so adding all the custom messages required by the zed ros 2 wrapper. you can find the documentation of the zed ros 2 wrapper and the tutorials online on the stereolabs documentation website. known issues with ros 2 foxy image transport and topic subscriptions there is an issue with the default version of the function camerapublisher::getnumsubscribers available in the binary version of the image_transport package preventing the correct counting of the number of nodes subscribing one of the topics published by an image_transport::camerapublisher object. we suggest installing the version v3.0.0 , published on 2021-05-26, that contains the fix for this issue. please note that earlier or later versions do not work as expected. to install the latest version from sources: cd ~/ros2_ws/src # access the source folder of your colcon workspace git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/image_common.git -b ros2 # clone the "ros" branch of the "image_common" repository cd <colcon_workspace> # go back to the root of your colcon workspace colcon build --symlink-install # compile everything and install close the console and re-open it to apply the modifications. image transport plugins and compressed topics the image_transport_plugins package is not correctly working with ros 2 foxy (see here , here , here , and here ). we suggest you remove it to avoid many annoying warning messages until the ros 2 developers fix it or use this workaround: sudo apt remove ros-foxy-image-transport-plugins ros-foxy-compressed-depth-image-transport ros-foxy-compressed-image-transport create a docker image with ros 2 for jetson agx orin docker containers let you run codes isolated from the host machine keeping it clean and avoiding version conflicts. here we discuss how to create a docker image with zed sdk and ros 2 foxy for jetson agx orin. create the dockerfile the dockerfile contains the set of commands that are used to build a docker image. by clicking on the link below you can download the dockerfile ready to create a docker image based on jetson linux v35.1, with preinstalled ros 2 foxy, the zed sdk v3.7.7, and the zed ros 2 wrapper: dockerfile download below we illustrate all the steps required to create the dockerfile. choose the right nvidia container to create the docker image and install the zed sdk an nvidia container as a parent container to build the docker image is required. nvidia provides multiple containers for jetson boards. for this docker image, we use the nvidia l4t jetpack container that containerizes all the accelerated libraries included in the jetpack sdk v5.0.2 that are required by the zed sdk v3.7.7. note that starting with the release r34.1 of jetson-linux the l4t-base container will not include cuda, cudnn, and tensorrt. install the zed sdk with jetpack 5.0.2 (l4t 35.1) support: arg

wrapper requires the cuda compiler during docker build. you must then modify the file /etc/docker/daemon.json before building the container: sudo gedit /etc/docker/daemon.json modify the file and save it: { "runtimes": { "nvidia": { "path": "nvidia-container-runtime", "runtimeargs": [] } }, "default-runtime": "nvidia" } you must restart the docker service before building the container to apply: sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl restart docker build the image from the dockerfile remember to add the current user to the docker group to run the build command without root privileges: sudo usermod -ag docker user log out and log in to apply the setting. now you can create a docker image with an appropriate tag docker build -t zed-3.7-ros2-foxy-jetson-jp5.0.2 . run the docker image thats it youve created the docker image with ros 2, the latest zed sdk, and a working ros 2 foxy environment. docker run -it --rm --net=host --runtime nvidia -e display=display -e nvidia_driver_capabilities=all -v /tmp/.x11-unix/:/tmp/.x11-unix -v {home}/.xauthority:/root/.xauthority --privileged -e display=display --gpus all zed-3.7-ros2-foxy-jetson-jp5.0.2 you can now start using stereolabs zed cameras with ros 2 on a docker container. for more information  using the zed ros 2 wrapper you can read the online documentation . if you need help or you have a question. you can  by email or write a post on our forum .
