tutorials beginner: client libraries creating a package edit on github warning youre reading the documentation for a version of ros 2 that has reached its eol endoflife, and is no longer officially supported. if you want uptodate information, please have a look at jazzy . creating a package  goal: create a new package using either cmake or python, and run its executable. tutorial level: beginner time: 15 minutes background  1 what is a ros 2 package?  a package is an organizational unit for your ros 2 code. if you want to be able to install your code or share it with others, then youll need it organized in a package. with packages, you can release your ros 2 work and allow others to build and use it easily. package creation in ros 2 uses ament as its build system and colcon as its build tool. you can create a package using either cmake or python, which are officially supported, though other build types do exist. 2 what makes up a ros 2 package?  ros 2 python and cmake packages each have their own minimum required contents: cmake python cmakelists.txt file that describes how to build the code within the package includepackagename directory containing the public headers for the package package.xml file containing meta information about the package src directory containing the source code for the package package.xml file containing meta information about the package resourcepackagename marker file for the package setup.cfg is required when a package has executables, so ros2 run can find them setup.py containing instructions for how to install the package packagename  a directory with the same name as your package, used by ros 2 tools to find your package, contains init.py the simplest possible package may have a file structure that looks like: cmake python mypackage cmakelists.txt includemypackage package.xml src mypackage package.xml resourcemypackage setup.cfg setup.py mypackage 3 packages in a workspace  a single workspace can contain as many packages as you want, each in their own folder. you can also have packages of different build types in one workspace cmake, python, etc.. you cannot have nested packages. best practice is to have a src folder within your workspace, and to create your packages in there. this keeps the top level of the workspace clean. a trivial workspace might look like: workspacefolder src cpppackage1 cmakelists.txt includecpppackage1 package.xml src pypackage1 package.xml resourcepypackage1 setup.cfg setup.py pypackage1 ... cpppackagen cmakelists.txt includecpppackagen package.xml src prerequisites  you should have a ros 2 workspace after following the instructions in the previous tutorial . you will create your package in this workspace. tasks  1 create a package  first, source your ros 2 installation . lets use the workspace you created in the previous tutorial , ros2ws , for your new package. make sure you are in the src folder before running the package creation command. linux macos windows cd ros2wssrc cd ros2wssrc cd ros2wssrc the command syntax for creating a new package in ros 2 is: cmake python ros2 pkg create buildtype amentcmake packagename ros2 pkg create buildtype amentpython packagename for this tutorial, you will use the optional argument nodename which creates a simple hello world type executable in the package. enter the following command in your terminal: cmake python ros2 pkg create buildtype amentcmake nodename mynode mypackage ros2 pkg create buildtype amentpython nodename mynode mypackage you will now have a new folder within your workspaces src directory called mypackage . after running the command, your terminal will return the message: cmake python going to create a new package package name: mypackage destination directory: homeuserros2wssrc package format: 3 version: 0.0.0 description: todo: package description maintainer: name email licenses: todo: license declaration build type: amentcmake dependencies:  nodename:

.mypackagemypackagemynode.py you can see the automatically generated files for the new package. 2 build a package  putting packages in a workspace is especially valuable because you can build many packages at once by running colcon build in the workspace root. otherwise, you would have to build each package individually. return to the root of your workspace: linux macos windows cd ros2ws cd ros2ws cd ros2ws now you can build your packages: linux macos windows colcon build colcon build colcon build mergeinstall windows doesnt allow long paths, so mergeinstall will combine all the paths into the install directory. recall from the last tutorial that you also have the rostutorials packages in your ros2ws . you might have noticed that running colcon build also built the turtlesim package. thats fine when you only have a few packages in your workspace, but when there are many packages, colcon build can take a long time. to build only the mypackage package next time, you can run: colcon build packagesselect mypackage 3 source the setup file  to use your new package and executable, first open a new terminal and source your main ros 2 installation. then, from inside the ros2ws directory, run the following command to source your workspace: linux macos windows source installlocalsetup.bash . installsetup.bash call installlocalsetup.bat now that your workspace has been added to your path, you will be able to use your new packages executables. 4 use the package  to run the executable you created using the nodename argument during package creation, enter the command: ros2 run mypackage mynode which will return a message to your terminal: cmake python hello world mypackage package hi from mypackage. 5 examine package contents  inside ros2wssrcmypackage , you will see the files and folders that ros2 pkg create automatically generated: cmake python cmakelists.txt include package.xml src mynode.cpp is inside the src directory. this is where all your custom c nodes will go in the future. mypackage package.xml resource setup.cfg setup.py test mynode.py is inside the mypackage directory. this is where all your custom python nodes will go in the future. 6 customize package.xml  you may have noticed in the return message after creating your package that the fields description and license contain todo notes. thats because the package description and license declaration are not automatically set, but are required if you ever want to release your package. the maintainer field may also need to be filled in. from ros2wssrcmypackage , open package.xml using your preferred text editor: cmake python ?xml version1.0? ?xmlmodel hrefhttp:download.ros.orgschemapackageformat3.xsd schematypenshttp:www.w3.org2001xmlschema? package format 3  name mypackage

testdepend testdepend python3pytest testdepend export buildtype amentpython buildtype export package input your name and email on the maintainer line if it hasnt been automatically populated for you. then, edit the description line to summarize the package: description beginner client libraries tutorials practice package description then, update the license line. you can read more about open source licenses here . since this package is only for practice, its safe to use any license. well use apache license 2.0 : license apache license 2.0 license dont forget to save once youre done editing. below the license tag, you will see some tag names ending with depend . this is where your package.xml would list its dependencies on other packages, for colcon to search for. mypackage is simple and doesnt have any dependencies, but you will see this space being utilized in upcoming tutorials. cmake python youre all done for now! the setup.py file contains the same description, maintainer and license fields as package.xml , so you need to set those as well. they need to match exactly in both files. the version and name  packagename  also need to match exactly, and should be automatically populated in both files. open setup.py with your preferred text editor. from setuptools import setup packagename  mypypkg setup  name  packagename , version  0.0.0 , packages   packagename , datafiles    shareamentindexresourceindexpackages ,  resource  packagename ,  share  packagename ,  package.xml , , installrequires   setuptools , zipsafe  true , maintainer  todo , maintaineremail  todo , description  todo: package description , license  todo: license declaration , testsrequire   pytest , entrypoints   consolescripts :  mynode  mypypkg.mynode:main , ,  edit the maintainer , maintaineremail , and description lines to match package.xml . dont forget to save the file. summary  youve created a package to organize your code and make it easy to use for others. your package was automatically populated with the necessary files, and then you used colcon to build it so you can use its executables in your local environment. next steps  next, lets add something meaningful to a package. youll start with a simple publishersubscriber system, which you can choose to write in either c or python . other versions v: foxy releases jazzy latest iron humble galactic
