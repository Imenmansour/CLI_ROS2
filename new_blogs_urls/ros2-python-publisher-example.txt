skip to content in this tutorial i will show you a ros2 python publisher example. i will break down the code so you can learn how to create your own ros2 publisher node in python. so, here well suppose we have a temperature sensor, and we want to publish the measured temperature every 2 seconds (at 0.5 hz). we will simulate the temperature measurement so we dont have to use a real sensor. >> ive also made a video tutorial  using a different example, but the principle is the same. watch this as an additional resource to this article: after watching the video, subscribe to the robotics back-end youtube channel so you dont miss the next tutorials!

before we can actually use the publisher, we need to initialize it. well do that in the constructor of the class, just after the node has been initialized. to create a publisher with rclpy you simply have to call the create_publisher() function from rclpy. this function takes at least 3 arguments: message (or interface) type. we use the int64 type weve just imported before. topic name. queue size. this is kind of a buffer for messages in case some of them are late. unless you send a lot of data at a high frequency, you probably dont need to worry  that. i often use 10 as a default value. add a method to publish a message plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter def publish_temperature ( self ) : temperature = random. randint ( 20 , 30 ) msg = int64 () msg.data = temperature self.temperature_publisher_. publish ( msg ) def publish_temperature(self): temperature = random.randint(20, 30) msg = int64() msg.data = temperature self.temperature_publisher_.publish(msg) def publish_temperature(self): temperature = random.randint(20, 30) msg = int64() msg.data = temperature self.temperature_publisher_.publish(msg) ok, we have a publisher, which will be initialized when the node is initialized. now, we need to be able to use the publisher to actually publish some messages on the topic. to do that, well first create a method that we can call from anywhere within the class. in this method we first create a random number for the temperature, since this is a simulation. in a real temperature sensor node, youd have another function which reads the data from the sensor. so, this first line wouldnt be here. the 3 following lines represent the core of this method: instantiate an int64 message object. fill the data field of the message with an integer  here the temperature data. use the publish() function from the publisher object to actually publish on the topic. add a timer to publish the message at a given rate plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter self.temperature_timer_ = self. create_timer ( 2.0 , self.publish_temperature ) self.temperature_timer_ = self.create_timer( 2.0, self.publish_temperature) self.temperature_timer_ = self.create_timer( 2.0, self.publish_temperature) even if this line was before the publish_temperature() method, ive put it after in the explanation, because thats usually the order in which youll write your code: initialize the publisher. create a function to publish on the topic. call this function from within your code  here as a callback in a timer. so, the create_timer() function from rclpy, as it name suggests, will create a timer. dont forget to store this timer in a class attribute so it stays in scope. you need to give 2 arguments: period to wait between 2 triggers: here 2 seconds (which corresponds to 0.5 hz). callback function. programs main plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter def main ( args= none ) : rclpy. init ( args=args ) node = temperaturesensornode () rclpy. spin ( node ) rclpy. shutdown () if __name__ == "__main__" : main () def main(args=none): rclpy.init(args=args) node = temperaturesensornode() rclpy.spin(node) rclpy.shutdown() if __name__ == "__main__": main() def main(args=none): rclpy.init(args=args) node = temperaturesensornode() rclpy.spin(node) rclpy.shutdown() if __name__ == "__main__": main() nothing special here: we just init ros2 communications, initialize the node, make the node spin, and finally shutdown ros2 communications. for more details  this sequence, check out how to write a minimal python node with rclpy . install and run your ros2 python publisher first, if you dont really know where to put your code: create a ros2 python package , and place the python file inside the folder that has the same name as the package. you can also make this file executable. plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/  ros2 pkg create ros2_tutorials_py --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy  cd ros2_tutorials_py/ros2_tutorials_py/  touch temperature_sensor.py  chmod +x temperature_sensor.py  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/  ros2 pkg create ros2_tutorials_py --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy  cd ros2_tutorials_py/ros2_tutorials_py/  touch temperature_sensor.py  chmod +x temperature_sensor.py  cd ~/ros2_ws/src/  ros2 pkg create ros2_tutorials_py --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy  cd ros2_tutorials_py/ros2_tutorials_py/  touch temperature_sensor.py  chmod +x temperature_sensor.py now that youve written the file, lets install the node so we can use it with the ros2 run ros2 run command line tool. install your publisher add one line inside the console_scripts array of your packages setup.py file. plain text copy to clipboard open code in new window enlighterjs 3 syntax highlighter ... entry_points= { 'console_scripts' : [ ...
