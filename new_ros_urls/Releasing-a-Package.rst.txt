(optionally) allow you to have automatic ci run for pull requests in your repository. follow one of the guides below to get your package released: :doc:`index your packages <index-your-packages>` - if this is the first release for the package :doc:`first time release <first-time-release>` - if this is the first release for the package, but it is already indexed :doc:`subsequent releases <subsequent-releases>` - if you are releasing a new version of a package that has already been released after successfully following the instructions, your package will be released into the ros ecosystem on the next distro synchronization! you cant perform that action at this time.
