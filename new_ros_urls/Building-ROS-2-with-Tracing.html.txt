how-to guides building ros 2 with tracing edit on github building ros 2 with tracing ï tracing instrumentation is included in the ros 2 source code, and linux installations of ros 2 include the lttng tracer as a dependency. therefore, ros 2 can be traced out-of-the-box on linux. however, ros 2 can be built from source to remove the tracepoints or completely remove the instrumentation. this guide shows how to do that. for more information, see the repository . note this guide only applies to linux systems. prerequisites ï set up your system to build ros 2 from source. see the source installation page for more information. build configurations ï the ros 2 tracing instrumentation is split into two components: function instrumentation and tracepoints. first, a ros 2 core package (e.g., rclcpp ) calls a function provided by the tracetools package. then, that function triggers a tracepoint, which records data if the tracepoint is enabled at runtime. by default, if the tracer is not configured to trace or if the tracepoints are not enabled , they will have virtually no impact on the execution. however, the tracepoints can still be removed through a cmake option. furthermore, the functions can be completely removed through a cmake option, which implies that tracepoints are also removed. building without tracepoints ï this step depends on whether you are building ros 2 from source or using ros 2 binaries ( deb packages or binary archive ). to remove the tracepoints, (re)build tracetools and set the tracetools_tracepoints_excluded cmake option to on : source installation binary installation cd ~/ros2_jazzy colcon build --packages-select tracetools --cmake-clean-cache --cmake-args -dtracetools_tracepoints_excluded = on clone the ros2_tracing repository into your workspace and build: cd ~/ws git clone https://github.com/ros2/ros2_tracing.git -b jazzy src/ros2_tracing colcon build --packages-select tracetools --cmake-args -dtracetools_tracepoints_excluded = on building without instrumentation ï to completely remove both tracepoints and function calls, build ros 2 from source and set the tracetools_disabled cmake option to on : cd ~/ros2_jazzy colcon build --cmake-args -dtracetools_disabled = on --no-warn-unused-cli validating ï validate that tracing is disabled: cd ~/ws source install/setup.bash ros2 run tracetools status it should print out: without tracepoints without instrumentation tracing disabled tracing disabled through configuration if something else is printed, then something went wrong. other versions v: jazzy releases jazzy (latest) iron humble galactic (eol) foxy (eol) eloquent (eol) dashing (eol) crystal (eol) in development rolling
