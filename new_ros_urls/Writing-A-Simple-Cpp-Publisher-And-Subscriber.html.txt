tutorials beginner: client libraries writing a simple publisher and subscriber (c++) edit on github writing a simple publisher and subscriber (c++) ï goal: create and run a publisher and subscriber node using c++. tutorial level: beginner time: 20 minutes background ï nodes are executable processes that communicate over the ros graph. in this tutorial, the nodes will pass information in the form of string messages to each other over a topic . the example used here is a simple âtalkerâ and âlistenerâ system; one node publishes data and the other subscribes to the topic so it can receive that data. the code used in these examples can be found here . prerequisites ï in previous tutorials, you learned how to create a workspace and create a package . tasks ï 1 create a package ï open a new terminal and source your ros 2 installation so that ros2 commands will work. navigate into the ros2_ws directory created in a previous tutorial . recall that packages should be created in the src directory, not the root of the workspace. so, navigate into ros2_ws/src , and run the package creation command: ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license apache-2.0 cpp_pubsub your terminal will return a message verifying the creation of your package cpp_pubsub and all its necessary files and folders. navigate into ros2_ws/src/cpp_pubsub/src . recall that this is the directory in any cmake package where the source files containing executables belong. 2 write the publisher node ï download the example talker code by entering the following command: linux macos windows wget -o publisher_lambda_function.cpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/examples/jazzy/rclcpp/topics/minimal_publisher/lambda.cpp wget -o publisher_lambda_function.cpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/examples/jazzy/rclcpp/topics/minimal_publisher/lambda.cpp in a windows command line prompt: curl -sk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/examples/jazzy/rclcpp/topics/minimal_publisher/lambda.cpp -o publisher_lambda_function.cpp or in powershell: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/examples/jazzy/rclcpp/topics/minimal_publisher/lambda.cpp -o publisher_lambda_function.cpp now there will be a new file named publisher_lambda_function.cpp . open the file using your preferred text editor. #include <chrono> #include <memory> #include <string> #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp" #include "std_msgs/msg/string.hpp" using namespace std :: chrono_literals ; /* this example creates a subclass of node and uses a fancy c++11 lambda * function to shorten the callback syntax, at the expense of making the * code somewhat more difficult to understand at first glance. */ class minimalpublisher : public rclcpp :: node { public : minimalpublisher () : node ( "minimal_publisher" ), count_ ( 0 ) { publisher_ = this -> create_publisher < std_msgs :: msg :: string > ( "topic" , 10 ); auto timer_callback = [ this ]() -> void { auto message = std_msgs :: msg :: string (); message . data = "hello, world! " + std :: to_string ( this -> count_ ++ ); rclcpp_info ( this -> get_logger (), "publishing: '%s'" , message . data . c_str ()); this -> publisher_ -> publish ( message ); }; timer_ = this -> create_wall_timer ( 500 ms , timer_callback ); } private : rclcpp :: timerbase :: sharedptr timer_ ; rclcpp :: publisher < std_msgs :: msg :: string >:: sharedptr publisher_ ; size_t count_ ; }; int main ( int argc , char * argv []) { rclcpp :: init ( argc , argv ); rclcpp :: spin ( std :: make_shared < minimalpublisher > ()); rclcpp :: shutdown (); return 0 ; } 2.1 examine the code ï the top of the code includes the standard c++ headers you will be using. after the standard c++ headers is the rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp include which allows you to use the most common pieces of the ros 2 system. last is std_msgs/msg/string.hpp , which includes the built-in message type you will use to publish data. #include <chrono> #include <memory> #include <string> #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp" #include "std_msgs/msg/string.hpp" using namespace std :: chrono_literals ; these lines represent the nodeâs dependencies. recall that dependencies have to be added to package.xml and cmakelists.txt , which youâll do in the next section. the next line creates the node class minimalpublisher by inheriting from rclcpp::node . every this in the code is referring to the node. class minimalpublisher : public rclcpp :: node the public constructor names the node minimal_publisher and initializes count_ to 0. inside the constructor, the publisher is initialized with the string message type, the topic name topic , and the required queue size to limit messages in the event of a backup. next, a lambda function called timer_callback is declared. it performs a by-reference capture of the current object this , takes no input arguments and returns void. the timer_callback function creates a new message of type string , sets its data with the desired string and publishes it. the rclcpp_info macro ensures every published message is printed to the console. at last, timer_ is initialized, which causes the timer_callback function to be executed twice a second. public : minimalpublisher () : node ( "minimal_publisher" ), count_ ( 0 ) { publisher_ = this -> create_publisher < std_msgs :: msg :: string > ( "topic" , 10 ); auto timer_callback = [ this ]() -> void { auto message = std_msgs :: msg :: string (); message . data = "hello, world! " + std :: to_string ( this -> count_ ++ ); rclcpp_info ( this -> get_logger (), "publishing: '%s'" , message . data . c_str ()); this -> publisher_ -> publish ( message ); }; timer_ = this -> create_wall_timer ( 500 ms , timer_callback ); } in the bottom of the class is the declaration of the timer, publisher, and counter fields. private : rclcpp :: timerbase :: sharedptr timer_ ; rclcpp :: publisher < std_msgs :: msg :: string >:: sharedptr publisher_ ; size_t count_ ; following the minimalpublisher class is main , where the node actually executes. rclcpp::init initializes ros 2, and rclcpp::spin starts processing data from the node, including callbacks from the timer. int main ( int argc , char * argv []) { rclcpp :: init ( argc , argv ); rclcpp :: spin ( std :: make_shared < minimalpublisher > ()); rclcpp :: shutdown (); return 0 ; } 2.2 add dependencies ï navigate one level back to the ros2_ws/src/cpp_pubsub directory, where the cmakelists.txt and package.xml files have been created for you. open package.xml with your text editor. as mentioned in the previous tutorial , make sure to fill in the <description> , <maintainer> and <license> tags: <description> examples of minimal publisher/subscriber using rclcpp </description> <maintainer = "you@.com" > your name </maintainer> <license> apache-2.0 </license> add a new line after the ament_cmake buildtool dependency and paste the following dependencies corresponding to your nodeâs include statements: <depend> rclcpp </depend> <depend> std_msgs </depend> this declares the package needs rclcpp and std_msgs when its code is built and executed. make sure to save the file. 2.3 cmakelists.txt ï now open the cmakelists.txt file. below the existing dependency find_package(ament_cmake required) , add the lines: find_package(rclcpp required) find_package(std_msgs required) after that, add the executable and name it talker so you can run your node using ros2 run : add_executable(talker src/publisher_lambda_function.cpp) ament_target_dependencies(talker rclcpp std_msgs) finally, add the install(targets...) section so ros2 run can find your executable: install(targets talker destination lib/{project_name}) you can clean up your cmakelists.txt by removing some unnecessary sections and comments, so it looks like this: cmake_minimum_required(version 3.5) project(cpp_pubsub) # default to c++14 if(not cmake_cxx_standard) set(cmake_cxx_standard 14) endif() if(cmake_compiler_is_gnucxx or cmake_cxx_compiler_id matches "clang") add_compile_options(-wall -wextra -wpedantic) endif() find_package(ament_cmake required) find_package(rclcpp required) find_package(std_msgs required) add_executable(talker src/publisher_lambda_function.cpp) ament_target_dependencies(talker rclcpp std_msgs) install(targets talker destination lib/{project_name}) ament_package() you could build your package now, source the local setup files, and run it, but letâs create the subscriber node first so you can see the full system at work. 3 write the subscriber node ï return to ros2_ws/src/cpp_pubsub/src to create the next node. enter the following code in your terminal: linux macos windows wget -o subscriber_lambda_function.cpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/examples/jazzy/rclcpp/topics/minimal_subscriber/lambda.cpp wget -o subscriber_lambda_function.cpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/examples/jazzy/rclcpp/topics/minimal_subscriber/lambda.cpp in a windows command line prompt: curl -sk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/examples/jazzy/rclcpp/topics/minimal_subscriber/lambda.cpp -o subscriber_lambda_function.cpp or in powershell: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/examples/jazzy/rclcpp/topics/minimal_subscriber/lambda.cpp -o subscriber_lambda_function.cpp check to ensure that these files exist: publisher_lambda_function.cpp subscriber_lambda_function.cpp open the subscriber_lambda_function.cpp with your text editor. #include <memory> #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp" #include "std_msgs/msg/string.hpp" class minimalsubscriber : public rclcpp :: node { public : minimalsubscriber () : node ( "minimal_subscriber" ) { auto topic_callback = [ this ]( std_msgs :: msg :: string :: uniqueptr msg ) -> void { rclcpp_info ( this -> get_logger (), "i heard: '%s'" , msg -> data . c_str ()); }; _ = this -> create_ < std_msgs :: msg :: string > ( "topic" , 10 , topic_callback ); } private : rclcpp ::  < std_msgs :: msg :: string >:: sharedptr _ ; }; int main ( int argc , char * argv []) { rclcpp :: init ( argc , argv ); rclcpp :: spin ( std :: make_shared < minimalsubscriber > ()); rclcpp :: shutdown (); return 0 ; } 3.1 examine the code ï the subscriber nodeâs code is nearly identical to the publisherâs. now the node is named minimal_subscriber , and the constructor uses the nodeâs create_ function to execute the callback. there is no timer because the subscriber simply responds whenever data is published to the topic topic. the topic_callback function receives the string message data published over the topic, and simply writes it to the console using the rclcpp_info macro. recall from the topic tutorial that the topic name and message type used by the publisher and subscriber must match to allow them to communicate. public : minimalsubscriber () : node ( "minimal_subscriber" ) { auto topic_callback = [ this ]( std_msgs :: msg :: string :: uniqueptr msg ) -> void { rclcpp_info ( this -> get_logger (), "i heard: '%s'" , msg -> data . c_str ()); }; _ = this -> create_ < std_msgs :: msg :: string > ( "topic" , 10 , topic_callback ); } the only field declaration in this class is the . private : rclcpp ::  < std_msgs :: msg :: string >:: sharedptr _ ; the main function is exactly the same, except now it spins the minimalsubscriber node. for the publisher node, spinning meant starting the timer, but for the subscriber it simply means preparing to receive messages whenever they come. since this node has the same dependencies as the publisher node, thereâs nothing new to add to package.xml . 3.2 cmakelists.txt ï reopen cmakelists.txt and add the executable and target for the subscriber node below the publisherâs entries. add_executable ( listener src/subscriber_lambda_function.cpp ) ament_target_dependencies ( listener rclcpp std_msgs ) install ( targets talker listener destination lib/ { project_name } ) make sure to save the file, and then your pub/sub system should be ready. 4 build and run ï you likely already have the rclcpp and std_msgs packages installed as part of your ros 2 system. itâs good practice to run rosdep in the root of your workspace ( ros2_ws ) to check for missing dependencies before building: linux macos windows rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro jazzy -y rosdep only runs on linux, so you can skip ahead to next step. rosdep only runs on linux, so you can skip ahead to next step. still in the root of your workspace, ros2_ws , build your new package: linux macos windows colcon build --packages-select cpp_pubsub colcon build --packages-select cpp_pubsub colcon build --merge-install --packages-select cpp_pubsub open a new terminal, navigate to ros2_ws , and source the setup files: linux macos windows . install/setup.bash . install/setup.bash call install/setup.bat now run the talker node: ros2 run cpp_pubsub talker the terminal should start publishing info messages every 0.5 seconds, like so: [info] [minimal_publisher]: publishing: "hello world: 0" [info] [minimal_publisher]: publishing: "hello world: 1" [info] [minimal_publisher]: publishing: "hello world: 2" [info] [minimal_publisher]: publishing: "hello world: 3" [info] [minimal_publisher]: publishing: "hello world: 4" open another terminal, source the setup files from inside ros2_ws again, and then start the listener node: ros2 run cpp_pubsub listener the listener will start printing messages to the console, starting at whatever message count the publisher is on at that time, like so: [info] [minimal_subscriber]: i heard: "hello world: 10" [info] [minimal_subscriber]: i heard: "hello world: 11" [info] [minimal_subscriber]: i heard: "hello world: 12" [info] [minimal_subscriber]: i heard: "hello world: 13" [info] [minimal_subscriber]: i heard: "hello world: 14" enter ctrl+c in each terminal to stop the nodes from spinning. summary ï you created two nodes to publish and subscribe to data over a topic. before compiling and running them, you added their dependencies and executables to the package configuration files. next steps ï next youâll create another simple ros 2 package using the service/client model. again, you can choose to write it in either c++ or python . related content ï there are several ways you could write a publisher and subscriber in c++;
