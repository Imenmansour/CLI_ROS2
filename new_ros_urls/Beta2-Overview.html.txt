distributions end-of-life distributions beta 2 ( r2b2 ) edit on github beta 2 ( r2b2 ) ï supported platforms ï we support ros 2 beta 2 on three platforms: ubuntu 16.04 (xenial), macos 10.12 (sierra), and windows 10. we provide both binary packages and instructions for how to compile from source for all 3 platforms (see install instructions as well as documentation ). features ï improvements since beta 1 release ï dds_security support (aka sros2, see sros2 ) debian packages for ubuntu xenial typesupport has been redesigned so that you only build a single executable and can choose one of the available rmw implementations by setting an environment variable (see documentation ). namespace support for nodes and topics (see design article , see known issues below). a set of command-line tools using the extensible ros2 command (see conceptual article ). a set of macros for logging messages in c / c++ (see api docs of rcutils ). new demo application ï turtlebot 2 demos using the following repositories that have been (partially) converted to ros 2 (linux only): ros_astra_camera depthimage_to_laserscan pcl_conversions cartographer cartographer_ros ceres-solver navigation teleop_twist_keyboard joystick_drivers teleop_twist_joy dummy_robot demo : robot_model robot_state_publisher selected features from previous alpha/beta releases ï for the complete list, see earlier release notes . c++ and python implementations of ros 2 client libraries including apis for: publishing and subscribing to ros topics requesting and replying ros services (synchronous (c++ only) and asynchronous) getting and setting ros parameters (c++ only, synchronous and asynchronous) timer callbacks support for interoperability between multiple dds/rtps implementations eprosima fast rtps is our default implementation, and is included in the binary packages rti connext is supported: build from source to try it out we initially supported prismtech opensplice but support for it is currently on hold a graph api for network events distributed discovery realtime safe code paths for publish and subscribe with compatible dds implementation (only connext at the moment) support for custom allocators ros 1 <-> ros 2 dynamic bridge node executor threading model (c++ only) component model to compose nodes at compile / link / runtime managed component using a standard lifecycle extended .msg format with new features: bounded arrays default values known issues ï weâre tracking issues in various repositories, but the main entry point is the ros2/ros2 issue tracker weâd like to highlight a known issue that we are looking into which doesnât allow two topics with the same base name but different namespaces to have a different type when using rmw_connext_cpp . services with long responses are not working with fast-rtps. the fix, while not being part of beta2, is available upstream so you can work around this issue by building from source using fast-rtps master branch. other versions v: jazzy releases jazzy (latest) iron humble galactic (eol) foxy (eol) eloquent (eol) dashing (eol) crystal (eol) in development rolling
