how-to guides migrating from ros 1 to ros 2 migrating interfaces edit on github migrating interfaces 誰 messages, services, and actions are collectively called interfaces in ros 2. interface definitions 誰 message files must end in .msg and must be located in the subfolder msg . service files must end in .srv and must be located in the subfolder srv . actions files must end in .action and must be located in the subfolder action . these files might need to be updated to comply with the ros interface definition . some primitive types have been removed and the types duration and time which were builtin types in ros 1 have been replaced with normal message definitions and must be used from the builtin_interfaces package. also some naming conventions are stricter than in ros 1. there is additional information in the conceptual article . building interfaces 誰 the way in which interfaces are built in ros 2 differs substantially from ros 1. interfaces can only be built from packages containing a cmakelists.txt . if you are developing a pure python package, then the interfaces should be placed in a different package containing only the interfaces (which is best practice anyway). see the custom interfaces tutorial for more information. migrating interface package to ros 2 誰 in your package.xml : add <buildtool_depend>rosidl_default_generators</buildtool_depend> . add <exec_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</exec_depend> . add <member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group> for each dependent message package, add <depend>message_package</depend> . in your cmakelists.txt : enable c++17 set ( cmake_cxx_standard 17 ) add find_package(rosidl_default_generators required) for each dependent message package, add find_package(message_package required) and replace the cmake function call to generate_messages with rosidl_generate_interfaces . this will replace add_message_files and add_service_files listing of all the message and service files, which can be removed. other versions v: jazzy releases jazzy (latest) iron humble galactic (eol) foxy (eol) eloquent (eol) dashing (eol) crystal (eol) in development rolling
