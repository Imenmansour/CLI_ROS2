distributions edit on github warning you're reading the documentation for a version of ros 2 that has reached its eol (end-of-life), and is no longer officially supported. if you want up-to-date information,  have a look at jazzy . distributions ï what is a distribution? ï a ros distribution is a versioned set of ros packages. these are akin to linux distributions (e.g. ubuntu). the purpose of the ros distributions is to let developers work against a relatively stable codebase until they are ready to roll everything forward. therefore once a distribution is released, we try to limit changes to bug fixes and non-breaking improvements for the core packages (every thing under ros-desktop-full). that generally applies to the whole community, but for âhigherâ level packages, the rules are less strict, and so it falls to the maintainers of a given package to avoid breaking changes. list of distributions ï below is a list of current and historic ros 2 distributions. rows in the table marked in green are the currently supported distributions. distro release date logo eol date galactic geochelone may 23rd, 2021 november 2022 foxy fitzroy june 5th, 2020 may 2023 eloquent elusor november 22nd, 2019 november 2020 dashing diademata may 31st, 2019 may 2021 crystal clemmys december 14th, 2018 december 2019 bouncy bolson july 2nd, 2018 july 2019 ardent apalone december 8th, 2017 december 2018 beta3 september 13th, 2017 december 2017 beta2 july 5th, 2017 september 2017 beta1 december 19th, 2016 jul 2017 alpha1 - alpha8 august 31th, 2015 december 2016 future distributions ï for details on upcoming features see the roadmap . there is a new ros 2 distribution released yearly on may 23rd ( world turtle day ). distro release date supported for planned changes humble hawksbill may 2022 tbd tbd the expectation is to release new ros 2 distributions once per year. rolling distribution ï the rolling distribution of ros 2 serves as a staging area for future stable distributions of ros 2 and as a collection of the most recent development releases. unlike most stable ros 2 distributions which have an initial release, a support window during which they are updated, and a definite end of support (see list of distributions above) the rolling distribution is continuously updated and is subject to in-place updates which will at times include breaking changes. packages released into the rolling distribution will be automatically released into future stable distributions of ros 2. releasing a ros 2 package into the rolling distribution follows the same procedures as all other ros 2 distributions. ros 2 rolling ridley is the rolling development distribution of ros 2 as proposed in rep 2002 . it was first introduced in june 2020. the rolling distribution will receive frequent and possibly compatibility-breaking releases in core packages and we recommend most people use the most recent stable distribution instead. since new stable distributions will be created from snapshots of the rolling distribution, package maintainers who want to make their packages available in future ros 2 distributions can do so by releasing their packages into the rolling distribution. other versions v: dashing releases jazzy (latest) iron humble galactic (eol) foxy (eol) eloquent (eol) dashing (eol) crystal (eol) in development rolling
