tutorials intermediate urdf generating an urdf file edit on github generating an urdf file Ã¯ goal: learn how to export and urdf file tutorial level: intermediate time: 5 minutes most roboticists work in teams, and often those teams include a mechanical engineer who develops a cad model of robot. instead of crafting an urdf by hand it is possible to export an urdf model from many different cad and modeling programs. these export tools are often developed by individuals that are familiar with the particular cad program they use. below you will find a list of available urdf exporters for a variety of cad and 3d modeling software systems. the ros core maintainers do not maintain these packages. as such we make no claims  their performance or ease of use. however, we figured it would be helpful to produce a list of available urdf exporters. cad exporters blender urdf exporter creo parametric urdf exporter freecad ros workbench robotcad (freecad overcross) freecad to gazebo exporter fusion 360 urdf exporter fusionsdf: fusion 360 to sdf exporter onshape urdf exporter solidworks urdf exporter exporturdf library (fusion360, onshape, solidworks) roboforge project (freemium / paid tooling) other urdf export and conversion tools gazebo sdformat to urdf parser sdf to urdf converter in python urdf to webots simulator format the blender robotics tools respository includes a number of useful tools, including a tool to export urdf files from blender. coppeliasim urdf exporter isaac sim urdf exporter viewing urdf & sdf files examples of common urdf launch files web viewer for urdf files: github repo & live website view sdf models in rviz jupyterlab urdf viewer if you have an urdf tool you like  consider adding it to the list above! other versions v: jazzy releases jazzy (latest) iron humble galactic (eol) foxy (eol) eloquent (eol) dashing (eol) crystal (eol) in development rolling
