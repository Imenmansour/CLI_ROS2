how-to guides developing a ros 2 package edit on github developing a ros 2 package ï this tutorial will teach you how to create your first ros 2 application. it is intended for developers who want to learn how to create custom packages in ros 2, not for people who want to use ros 2 with its existing packages. prerequisites ï install ros install colcon setup your workspace by sourcing your ros 2 installation. creating a package ï all ros 2 packages begin by running the command ros2 pkg create --license apache-2.0 <pkg-name> --dependencies [ deps ] in your workspace (usually ~/ros2_ws/src ). to create a package for a specific client library: c++ python ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license apache-2.0 <pkg-name> --dependencies [ deps ] ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --license apache-2.0 <pkg-name> --dependencies [ deps ] you can then update the package.xml with your package info such as dependencies, descriptions, and authorship. c++ packages ï you will mostly use the add_executable() cmake macro along with ament_target_dependencies ( <executable-name> [dependencies] ) to create executable nodes and link dependencies. to install your launch files and nodes, you can use the install() macro placed towards the end of the file but before the ament_package() macro. an example for launch files and nodes: # install launch files install ( directory launch destination share/ { project_name } ) # install nodes install ( targets [node-names] destination lib/ { project_name } ) python packages ï ros 2 follows pythonâs standard module distribution process that uses setuptools . for python packages, the setup.py file complements a c++ packageâs cmakelists.txt . more details on distribution can be found in the official documentation . in your ros 2 package, you should have a setup.cfg file which looks like: [ develop ] script_dir = base /lib/<package-name> [ install ] install_scripts = base /lib/<package-name> and a setup.py file that looks like: import os from glob import glob from setuptools import find_packages , setup package_name = 'my_package' setup ( name = package_name , version = '0.0.0' , # packages to export packages = find_packages ( exclude = [ 'test' ]), # files we want to install, specifically launch files data_files = [ # install marker file in the package index ( 'share/ament_index/resource_index/packages' , [ 'resource/' + package_name ]), # include our package.xml file ( os . path . join ( 'share' , package_name ), [ 'package.xml' ]), # include all launch files. ( os . path . join ( 'share' , package_name , 'launch' ), glob ( os . path . join ( 'launch' , '*launch.[pxy][yma]*' ))), ], # this is important as well install_requires = [ 'setuptools' ], zip_safe = true , author = 'ros 2 developer' , author_ = 'ros2@ros.com' , maintainer = 'ros 2 developer' , maintainer_ = 'ros2@ros.com' , keywords = [ 'foo' , 'bar' ], classifiers = [ 'intended audience :: developers' , 'license :: todo' , 'programming language :: python' , 'topic :: software development' , ], description = 'my awesome package.' , license = 'todo' , # like the cmakelists add_executable macro, you can add your python # scripts here. entry_points = { 'console_scripts' : [ 'my_script = my_package.my_script:main' ], }, ) combined c++ and python packages ï when writing a package with both c++ and python code, the setup.py file and setup.cfg file are not used. instead, use ament_cmake_python . other versions v: jazzy releases jazzy (latest) iron humble galactic (eol) foxy (eol) eloquent (eol) dashing (eol) crystal (eol) in development rolling
