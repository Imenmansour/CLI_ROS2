the ros 2 project contributing edit on github warning you're reading the documentation for a version of ros 2 that has reached its eol (end-of-life), and is no longer officially supported. if you want up-to-date information,  have a look at jazzy . contributing ï a few things to remember before you start contributing to the ros 2 project. tenets ï respect what came before ros has been around for more than a decade and is used by developers and across the world. keep a humble attitude and an open mindset while contributing. engage open robotics as early as possible open robotics acts as a gate-keeper and advocate for the ros community. rely on their expertise and technical judgement from the design phase. start discussions with open robotics and the community early. long time ros contributors may have a clearer vision of the bigger picture. if you implement a feature and send a pull request without discussing with the community first, you are taking the risk of it being rejected, or you may be asked to largely rethink your design. opening issues or using discourse to socialize an idea before starting the implementation is generally preferable. adopt community best-practices whenever possible instead of ad-hoc processes think  your end-userâs experience when developing and contributing. avoid using non-standard tools or libraries that may not be accessible to everyone. think  the community as a whole think  the bigger picture. there are developers building different robots with different constraints. ros needs to accommodate requirements of the whole community. there are a number of ways you can contribute to the ros 2 project. discussions and support ï some of the easiest ways to contribute to ros 2 involve engaging in community discussions and support. you can find more information on how to pitch in on the  page. contributing code ï setting up your development environment ï to get started, youâll want to install from source;
